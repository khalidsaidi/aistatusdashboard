- Updated `lib/data/providers.json` to include the `google` alias so `/provider/google` resolves to the Gemini provider page.
- Locked `MCP_REGISTRY_URL` to the canonical registry listing to keep `/ai` and MCP callouts stable.
- Updated `server.json` to set `websiteUrl` to `/ai` and bumped the MCP registry version to `1.0.1` so the registry listing links back to the AI landing page.
- Re-deployed App Hosting backend after the link updates to keep production in sync.
- 2026-01-13: Baseline audit returned 200 for all discovery endpoints; no fixes required for this pass.
- 2026-01-13: Added nodejs runtime + fallbacks for RSS, sitemap, datasets, and markdown mirrors to guarantee 200 responses (verified via `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/rss.xml`, `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/sitemap.xml`, `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/datasets/incidents.ndjson`, `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/docs.md`).
- 2026-01-13: Hardened incident permalink rendering (URL decoding + 404 on missing + impact scope + Event JSON-LD) and updated OpenAPI YAML fallbacks (verified via `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/incidents/<id>` and `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/openapi.yaml`).
- 2026-01-13: Updated markdown mirrors to reference OpenAPI YAML + dataset CSV, and added fallback for discoverability audit markdown (verified via `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/llms.txt` and `curl -i https://aistatusdashboard.com/docs/discoverability-audit.md`).
- 2026-01-13: Generated static discovery assets under `public/` (sitemap/rss/datasets/markdown/openapi YAML), removed dynamic route handlers for those paths, and added discovery headers + middleware bypass for crawl surfaces (verified locally via `node scripts/generate-static-discovery-assets.cjs`).
- 2026-01-13: Added discovery response headers in `middleware.ts` for static crawl surfaces to guarantee consistent Content-Type and debug tracing across edges.
- 2026-01-13: Added discovery audit JSON/HTML generator (public `/discovery/audit/latest.json`) and linked it from `/ai`, `llms.txt`, and sitemap; added CI guard + post-deploy smoke checks to prevent regressions.
- 2026-01-13: Removed stale static llms files and forced dynamic no-store responses so `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` always include the discovery audit URLs.
- 2026-01-13: Replaced robots.txt with explicit allowlist policy, enforced public cache-control and index headers on discovery surfaces, added discovery policy CI check, and extended discovery audit JSON with policy checks.
- 2026-01-13: Added robots.txt discovery headers and explicit cache-control for robots/openapi JSON in middleware to remove private caching for crawlers.
